1.Import the dataset and load it into a pandas dataframe.

2.Check for missing values.

3.Check the data types of the columns.

4.Get the summary statistics of the numerical columns (mean, median, min, max, standard deviation, etc.).

5.Visualize the distribution of the numerical columns using histograms and box plots.

6.Check for outliers.

7.Visualize the relationship between the independent variables (age, bmi, children) and the dependent variable (charges) using scatter plots.

8.Check the distribution of categorical variables (sex, smoker, region) using bar plots.

9.Analyze the effect of each independent variable (age, bmi, children, smoker, region) on the dependent variable (charges) using ANOVA or other statistical tests.

10.To evaluate a linear regression model, you can use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics. These metrics provide an indication of how well the model fits the data, and they quantify the difference between the predicted values and the actual values in the target variable.
